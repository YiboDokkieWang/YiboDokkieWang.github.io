The charging convenience of electric vehicles determines the user experience and is one of the most important indicators affecting the popularization of electric vehicles. The onboard charger (OBC) is the interface that links the AC grid to the onboard battery pack. Its conversion efficiency directly affects the electrical mileage of electric vehicles, and its performance impacts the life cycle of battery packs. In the next generation of grid-connected electric vehicles, the onboard battery packs will play the role of a distributed energy storage system. Therefore, it requires the OBC to have the function of feeding power back to the grid, namely V2G. The DCX is the core element of the OBC adapted to V2G. For DCX, how to adapt to the ultra-wide voltage range of the battery terminal, squeeze the frequency modulation range, and improve the conversion efficiency over the wide voltage range are key research topics.
