The traditional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms for photovoltaic (PV) arrays have been well-established; however, achieving global maximum power tracking (GMPPT) remains challenging when local shadows occur. Swarm search algorithms, like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), have been introduced to enhance MPPT control. Despite this, the convergence ability of such algorithms is dependent on core parameters, which can lead to system oscillation under certain conditions. To address this issue, the Jump Explore Incremental Conductance (JEINC) method, based on Incremental Conductance (INC), was proposed. JEINC offers better exploration capability than traditional methods, enabling effective GMPPT under partial shading and ensuring faster stabilization near the maximum power point.
