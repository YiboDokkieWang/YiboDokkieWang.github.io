With the deep penetration of emerging technologies including big data and cloud computing, there is a growing demand for low voltage, ultra-high current power management systems, such as data center voltage regulator modules and point-of-load converters. The power supply requirements of these applications pose significant challenges to power electronics. Multi-phase interleave technology is a feasible solution to resolve this technical challenge. However, for multi-phase systems, the temperature mismatch between modules will seriously deteriorate the system lifespan. Therefore, the thermal equalization control strategy is needed to improve the operation of a multi-phase interleaved parallel system, prolong the system life, and improve the system reliability.
