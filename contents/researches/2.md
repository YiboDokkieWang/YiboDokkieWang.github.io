With the evolvement of energy storage technology, rechargeable battery has become the most common portable power supply. In energy storage systems, individual cells have mismatch in capacity, voltage rate, and temperature characteristics due to the manufacturing process. Mismatched battery cells are expected to be equalized via properly designed management and equalization strategies to maintain safety and reliability. However, due to battery electrochemistry characteristics, there exists voltage recovery after equalization, causing the final equalization result inaccurate. Therefore, the behavior of batteries is worth further study, and more accurate and intelligent control strategies are needed.
